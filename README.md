# Predicting Corporate Bankruptcy Using Machine Learning

Project Overview üìù
This project aims to predict bankruptcy in companies using a comprehensive dataset containing various financial indicators. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we explore and preprocess the data to develop robust predictive models. This includes handling data imbalances, missing values, and outliers to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our predictions.

Context:
A major financial institution aims to enhance its risk analysis capabilities by implementing machine learning models to predict the probability of corporate bankruptcy two years in advance. Utilizing historical data and key financial variables, the goal is to develop a system that identifies at-risk companies, allowing the institution to make informed and proactive decisions.

Project Objective:
Design and develop machine learning models to predict corporate bankruptcy two years into the future using provided historical financial data. The results will be used to create risk mitigation strategies and improve decision-making in credit lending and portfolio management.

Provided Data:
Historical financial data from various companies
Key financial variables such as revenue, profit margins, debt levels, and cash flow
Time-series data to track financial performance over multiple years

Highlights:

Data Import and Exploration üìä
Imported necessary libraries and the dataset.
Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships of financial indicators.



Data Preprocessing üõ†Ô∏è
In-depth analysis and cleaning of the dataset to handle imbalances, missing values, and outliers.
Evaluated and removed outliers using the Z-score technique.
Addressed data imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).


Feature Engineering: Creation of new features and transformation of existing ones to enhance model performance.

Data Visualization üìà
Created bar plots and box plots to visualize the distribution of features and their relationships with the bankruptcy indicator (BK).
Generated a correlation matrix to identify the strength and direction of relationships between variables.


Model Development ü§ñ
 Implementing the chosen model into a user-friendly system that provides real-time predictions for corporate bankruptcy risk.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, recall, and precision.
Training various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, to identify the best performing model.

Model Evaluation: Assessing models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable predictions.



Risk Mitigation Strategies: Using model results to develop proactive strategies for credit lending and portfolio management.


Conclusion üéØ
This project effectively demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict bankruptcy, utilizing various preprocessing and modeling steps to handle the intricacies of the dataset. The insights and models developed here can significantly aid in identifying potential bankruptcies, providing valuable foresight for financial analysis and decision-making.
